## About
We present *lil*Gym, a new benchmark for language-conditioned reinforcement learning in visual environments. *lil*Gym is based on 2,661 highly-compositional human-written natural language statements grounded in an interactive visual environment. We annotate all statements with executable Python programs representing their meaning to enable exact reward computation in every possible world state. 

Each statement is paired with multiple start states and reward functions to form thousands of distinct Markov Decision Processes of varying difficulty. 
 
We experiment with *lil*Gym with different models and learning regimes. Our results and analysis show that while existing methods are able to achieve non-trivial performance, *lil*Gym forms a challenging open problem.

## Data

The [data and details](https://github.com/lil-lab/lilgym/tree/main/lilgym/data) can be found in: `lilgym/data/`.

A description can be found in [lilGym: Natural Language Visual Reasoning with Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.01994). The data is based on the [Cornell Natural Language Visual Reasoning (NLVR) Corpus v1.0 (Suhr et al. 2017)](https://aclanthology.org/P17-2034/) corpus.

## Codebase

### Installation

1. Create a conda environment (Python >= 3.7)
```
conda create -n lilgym python=3.7
conda activate lilgym
```

2. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/lil-lab/lilgym.git`

3. Install the dependencies
```
cd lilgym
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Note: the environment is updated to be used with Gymnasium (formerly Gym).

To install the package from source:
```
cd lilgym
pip install .
```

### Example

The environments follow standard Gym API.

Following is a short demo script:

```python
import gymnasium as gym

env = gym.make("TowerScratch-v0", split="train", stop_forcing=False, disable_env_checker=True)

env.seed(1)
observation, info = env.reset()

for _ in range(100):
    action = env.action_space.sample()
    observation, reward, terminated, truncated, info = env.step(action)

    if done:
        observation, info = env.reset()
```

Note: `disable_env_checker` comes with [Gymnasium](https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/Gymnasium) (new Gym), and can be set to `False` if needed.

**Configurations**

There are four configurations: `TowerScratch`, `TowerFlipIt`, `ScatterScratch` and `ScatterFlipIt`. Examples:

```python
env = gym.make("TowerFlipIt-v0", split="train", stop_forcing=False)

env = gym.make("ScatterScratch-v0", split="dev", stop_forcing=False)

env = gym.make("ScatterFlipIt-v0", split="test", stop_forcing=False)
```

**Data splits**

There are three data splits for each configuration: `train`, `dev`, and `test`.

**Stop forcing**

`stop_forcing` specifies whether to use the algorithm with stop forcing at training time. Inference is always done without stop forcing.

**Data reading**

There are two ways to load data:

1. Using the argument `split` as above

2. Using the argument `data`. An example:

```python
import gym
from lilgym.data.utils import get_data

data = get_data('tower', 'scratch', 'train')
env = gym.make("TowerScratch-v0", data=data, stop_forcing=True)
```

More details about the environment can be found in: `lilgym/envs/README.md`.

The baselines with the training and inference code will also be soon released.
